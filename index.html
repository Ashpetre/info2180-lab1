    and they love to stress me out to be funny. why im interested in web devolopment is that i use websites 
    all the time and its very interesting to know how they work and to be able to create a webstie that people 
    will enjoy using, just like how i enjoy using Youtube, Twitter and illegal site to stream my movies.  </p>
